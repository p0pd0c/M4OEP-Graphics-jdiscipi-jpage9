DND Dice Roll Program

## How it works
There is a dice roller class which has the static methods we need to calculate a random roll based on the number of sides and the modifier selected by the user.

## UI
The left menu shows the options for the number of sides on the die, while the right menu allows the user to select a modifier.

The user can then press the roll button as many times as they would like to roll the die with the proper parameters.

The user is allowed to see the result of a roll by clicking the 'Reveal Roll' button.
